                                        <strong>C) Release of liability, waiver, indemnification, and consent to medical attention and use of images</strong>
                                        <br> I understand that all Risers training activities carry with them significant risks. Although Risers have taken reasonable and prudent steps to reduce foreseeable risks, they still exist. Accordingly, in exchange for my child or ward being allowed to participate in Risers training, to be conducted at the location identified on the training registration form, we, the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) (individually and collectively referred to on the training registration form in the first person singular) of the child or ward identified on the training registration form agree to be bound by each of the following:
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Voluntary Participation.
                                                <br>I understand and confirm that our child or ward’s participation in the training is voluntary.</li>
                                            <li>Identification of Risks.
                                                <br>I understand that the Risers training may take place at various locations in Michigan. I understand that there are certain dangers, hazards, and risks inherent in training activities. I also understand that medical facilities or treatment may be inadequate or unavailable during the training. I understand that our child’s or ward’s participation in the training may involve risk of injury and loss, both to person and to property. I also understand that the risk of injury may include the possibility of permanent disability and death. There may be other risks not known to Risers and not reasonably foreseeable at this time. I understand that this release of liability, waiver, indemnification, and consent is intended to address all of the risks of any kind associated with my child’s or ward’s participation in any aspect of the training, including, particularly, such risks created by actions, inactions, or negligence on the part of Risers or its directors, officers, employees, agents, volunteers, successors, or assigns.</li>
                                            <li>Assumption of Risk.
                                                <br>I assume all risks, known and unknown, foreseeable and unforeseeable, in any way connected with my child’s or ward’s participation in the Risers training. I accept personal responsibility for any liability, injury, loss, or damage in any way connected with my child’s or ward’s participation in the Risers training.</li>
                                            <li>Release and Waiver.
                                                <br>I release Risers and its directors, officers, employees, agents, volunteers, successors, and assigns from any and all liability for and waive any and all claims for injury, loss, or damage, including attorneys’ fees, in any way connected with my child’s or ward’s participation in the Risers training, whether or not caused in whole or in part by the negligence or other misconduct of Risers or any of the individuals mentioned above.</li>
                                            <li>Indemnification.
                                                <br>I agree to indemnify and to hold harmless (in other words, to reimburse and to be responsible for) Risers and its directors, officers, employees, agents, volunteers, successors, and assigns, from all claims for any liability, injury, loss, damage, or expense, including attorneys’ fees (including the cost of defending any Claim I might make, or that might be made on my or my child’s or ward’s behalf, that is released or waived by this instrument), in any way connected with or arising out of my child’s or ward’s participation in the Risers training, whether or not caused in whole or in part by the negligence or other misconduct of Risers or any of the individuals mentioned above.</li>
                                            <li>Statute of Limitations.

                                            <li>Waiver of Jury Trial.
                                                <br>Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.</li>
                                            <li>Binding Effect.
                                                <br>This instrument shall be binding, jointly and severally, upon my child’s or ward’s relatives, personal representatives, heirs, beneficiaries, next of kin, or assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Risers, the Risers training, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, volunteers, successors, and assigns.</li>
                                            <li>Consent to Medical Treatment.
                                                <br>I authorize Risers and its representatives, if present, to provide to my child or ward, through medical personnel of their choice, customary medical assistance, transportation, and emergency medical services should my child or ward require such assistance, transportation, or services as a result of injury or damage related to any participation in the Risers training. This consent does not impose a duty upon Risers or its representatives, to provide such assistance, transportation, or services.</li>
                                            <li>Use of Images.
                                                <br>By agreement on this form, I grant to Risers, its successors and assigns, the right to use, publish in compliance with NCAA amateur regulations (in any medium, but not limited to, print, digital, or display and transmission on the Internet), publicly display and perform (in any format, but not limited to, film, slide, television, digital display and/or transmission on the Internet), and copyright for its fundraising, marketing, educational media project, and other commercial purposes (the “Project”), photographs and/or video-taped interviews of my child or ward (collectively, the “Multi-Media Works”).
                                                <br>By agreement on this form and in consideration for Riser’s agreement to have the Multi-Media Works taken for the possibility of being featured in the Risers Project, and the expense that it may incur in having the Multi-Media Works taken, processed, and produced, I release, on behalf of myself and my child or ward, Risers, its directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, assigns, and all persons acting under Risers’s permission or authority, from any liability for, and waive any and all claims for injury, loss, damage, or compensation, or any other claims (including libel and slander, invasion of privacy, and violation of publicity rights) in any way connected with me and my child or ward, and arising out of Risers’s use of the Multi-Media Works in its Project.
                                                <br>Finally, by agreement on this form, I waive any right that I, or my child or ward, may have to inspect or to approve the Multi-Media Works’ finished product or other copy that Risers may choose to use for the Project or in connection with other materials related to Risers, its business, and products. By agreement on this form, I understand and agree to the terms above. I understand that I am giving up rights by agreeing to it. I am agreeing to it voluntarily.</li>
                                            <li>Severability.
                                                <br>If any provision (or portion of any provision) of this instrument is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforceable in part to the fullest extent permitted by law, and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not otherwise affect any other provision of this instrument.</li>
                                            <li>Applicable Law.
                                                <br>Because the Risers training is conducted in the State of Michigan and in order to provide certainty in the law to be applied to the construction of this instrument, this instrument shall be governed, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan.</li>
                                        </ol>
