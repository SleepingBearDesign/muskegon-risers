Sports teams in any capacity hold a high level of responsibility to model health and wellness within their community. Today, Muskegon Risers SC is proud to announce that Mercy Health has become a key partner in this realm.

In a deal which extends through February of 2016, Mercy Health will provide the team with comprehensive services including Athletic Training, Physical Therapy, and Strength & Conditioning through the Mercy Health Athletic Performance Center.

For the Risers as a startup, relationships like this will provide a solid foundation for sustainabilty and growth well into the future. This partnership will also help integrate the health and wellness initiatives of Mercy Health into the grassroots outreach movements of Muskegon Risers SC. We are enthusiastic about this partnership and the tangible impact it will have on the MKG Lakeshore!
