The Fourth of July weekend is behind us, and your Muskegon Risers look to continue their undefeated home winning streak, in what will be a much anticipated match against Detroit Waza Flo Pro. The match will be held at Reeths Puffer High School’s soccer field, beginning Saturday, at 6pm.

Following the Risers 4-0 victory, in their previous match against the Michigan Stars, the team will look to continue their undefeated home record. To continue the streak, the Risers will rely on Bandile Mathandela, and captain Jamie Waters, for their defensive leadership in order to continue the team’s strong performance on the back line. As for the offensive side, keep an eye on forwards Jeff McClure, Matt Schmitt and Brogan Shrimpton. The three have formed a trio, which are proving to be a nightmare for the opposition to handle.

The interns will be downtown this Saturday morning, at the Muskegon Farmer’s Market, where they will be helping vendors as well as selling merchandise and 2016 season tickets.

The national anthem, for Saturday’s match, will be sung by Muskegon’s own, Kim Curcuru.

This week also marked the third week, of the Risers’ community outreach program, *MKG Rising*. An outreach program dedicated to providing summer recreation programs for the Muskegon Heights youth. The Risers have seen a steady increase in numbers, for the *MKG Rising* program, and believe the program will only continue to grow.

We hope to see everyone Saturday night, and as always Muskegon, RISE AND GRIND!
