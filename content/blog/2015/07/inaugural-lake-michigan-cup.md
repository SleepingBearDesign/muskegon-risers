All rivalries, in sports, begin with a tale. A story of how the two teams developed such a rich tradition. For a first-year franchise, like that of the Muskegon Risers, tradition is not something they have been associated with. Rather developing, and beginning tradition has been the emphasis. Creating an experience to last for years to come is the opportunity the Muskegon Risers will have, with an established franchise just across the lake, in the Milwaukee Brewers FC.

In an interview with Risers’ owner, Matt Schmitt, he stated “The Lake Michigan Cup will be a cornerstone of both programs well into the future. Furthermore, the trophy helps recognize Lake Michigan as a major asset to both Muskegon and Milwaukee, while also furthering the longstanding cultural relationship between both cities.” A similar vision Matt has had for the Risers since their establishment last year. Matt saw the platform, of professional soccer, as a way to tie communities together and highlight Muskegon’s natural beauty.

As for the Milwaukee Brewers, head coach Jim Keller had this to say of The Lake Michigan Cup, “our fans are excited; this cup will allow our team to expand our horizons against a quality opponent.” After winning the Wisconsin Soccer League championship last weekend, the Brewers will come into the inaugural match looking to continue their winning ways. With captain Andrew Davis, in the midfield, the team will have their eyes set on ruining the Risers’ undefeated home record, and sailing back across the lake, with the Lake Michigan Cup in hand.

The match will be set for Saturday, at 6pm, on the Risers’ home field. Be sure to arrive early, for the match, and check-out the brand new Lake Michigan Cup trophy.

We will see you Saturday, but as always Muskegon, be sure to rise and grind until then!
