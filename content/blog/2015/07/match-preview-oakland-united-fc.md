Your Muskegon Risers have extended their undefeated home record to seven matches and will look to put their streak on the line, in what will be a much anticipated match against Oakland United FC, of the Great Lakes Premier League. Saturday’s match against Oakland United FC will be called “Youth Soccer Night.” In respect to the kids who have supported the Muskegon Risers, all youth wearing their team’s jersey will be granted free admission for the game. The match will be held at Reeths Puffer High School’s soccer field, beginning Saturday, at 6pm.

Following the Risers’ 2-1 victory, in their previous match against Detroit Waza Flo Pro, the team will look to continue their undefeated home record. After earning Kenids Man of the Match honors, for his game winning bicycle kick goal, Bandile Mathandela will look to continue his hot streak Saturday night. Also on the back line, goalie Reece Richardson will need to turn-in another stellar performance if the Risers hope to extend their undefeated home record to an impressive eight matches. As for the offensive side, keep an eye on recent addition, Robby Gunderson. Since joining the Muskegon Risers team a few weeks ago, Robby’s cheetah-like speed has proven to be near impossible for defenders to keep up with.

The interns will be downtown this Saturday morning, at the Muskegon Farmer’s Market, where they will be helping vendors as well as selling merchandise and 2016 season tickets.

Muskegon’s own, Logan White, will be singing the National Anthem for Saturday’s match.

This week also marked the fourth week, of the Risers’ community outreach program, MKG Rising. An outreach program dedicated to providing summer recreation programs for the Muskegon Heights youth. The Risers have seen a steady increase in numbers, for the MKG Rising program, and believe the program will only continue to grow.

We hope to see everyone Saturday night, and as always Muskegon, RISE AND GRIND!
