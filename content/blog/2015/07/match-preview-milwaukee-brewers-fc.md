After continuing their dominance at home, against Oakland United FC, your Muskegon Risers will look to continue their undefeated home record against another strong opponent, in the Milwaukee Brewers FC. Saturday’s match against the Milwaukee Brewers FC will be the inaugural match, of what will become a traveling trophy between the two franchises called, “The Lake Michigan Cup.” Highlighting an asset to both Muskegon, and Milwaukee, the cup will be a traveling trophy and serve as the building blocks of a long-term series between the two clubs. The match will be held at Reeths Puffer High School’s soccer field, beginning Saturday, at 6pm.

Following the Risers’ 3-1 victory, in their previous match against Oakland United FC, the team will need to stay focused, in training this week, or they will risk losing their undefeated home record. Following his impressive Kenids Man of the Match performance, Robby Gunderson will look to continue his hot streak against a strong Milwaukee defense that will be looking to keep Robby off the scoreboard. After the events of last weekend’s match, Risers’ defender Bandile Mathandela has been suspended from play for his red card. The Risers will look to veteran central defenders Jai Maw, and Alexi Munro, to keep things calm on defense with Banidle’s absence. As for the offensive side, keep an eye on the local talent this weekend. After looking sharp in training; Job Potter, Ryan Wagenmaker, Eric Hilt and Justin Cartwright are looking to wreak havoc on Milwaukee’s back line as the team goes for an unheard of nine game home winning streak.

The interns will be downtown this Saturday morning, at the Muskegon Farmer’s Market, where they will be helping vendors as well as selling merchandise and 2016 season tickets.

This week’s creative halftime entertainment will be inspired by the popular board game, Hungry Hungry Hippo. We will need fan participation for the event, so be sure to get to the match early for details on how to get involved!

The team will also be at Nelson Elementary School, Friday afternoon from 3-4pm. The guys will be supporting the Boys and Girls Club of the Muskegon Lakeshore’s event, BeFit Festival, where they will be promoting healthy living for the next generation alongside other Muskegon businesses.

We hope to see everyone Saturday night, and as always Muskegon, RISE AND GRIND!
