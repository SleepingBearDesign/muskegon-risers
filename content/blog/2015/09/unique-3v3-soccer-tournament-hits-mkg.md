Muskegon Risers SC was created to help promote positive social and economic change along the MKG lakeshore. In the spirit of this purpose, the team will play Detroit Waza Flo in the L.C. Walker Arena on December 12 at 6pm, marking the first event of its kind in downtown Muskegon.

During the day on December 12, the Risers will be hosting a 3v3 tournament in the L.C. Walker Arena titled ‘Orbit 3v3 by MKG’. The tournament will provide a unique athletic experience in downtown Muskegon and also signifies lakeshore innovation.

Orbit 3v3 was invented and patented in Muskegon County during the summer of 2014. The game is played on a circular field with mini-goals and a futsal ball (View Rules). Substitutions are made on-the-fly just like hockey to limit stoppage of play. 4 players per roster, each receiving a ticket to the Risers game with $120 team registration. Divisions are Boys and Girls U12, U15 and U18.
