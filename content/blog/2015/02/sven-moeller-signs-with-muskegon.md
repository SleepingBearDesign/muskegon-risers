The Risers coaching staff is continuing to blend local and international talent ahead of year one. Sven Moeller, a native of Frankfurt, Germany, is the staff’s latest addition.

Moeller, a 5’8″ midfielder, played professionally in Germany before attending Judson University from 2008-2011. Moeller played 55 games for the Eagles, scoring 13 goals and providing 17 assists. During his three years, Moeller helped Judson to CCAC Tournament Championship, a NAIA National Tournament appearance, a CCAC regular season championship and a NCCAA National Championship.

>I am excited to join the Muskegon Risers and to be a part of the growing soccer culture in West Michigan. I look forward to joining the club for its inaugural season, and playing on a team that will excite our soccer fans and community.
