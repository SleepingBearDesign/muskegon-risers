Jubenal Rodriguez is a Muskegon Lakeshore product, and in speaking with him, you can tell this opportunity hits home.

>It is a privilege to represent Muskegon and wear the lime/ royal colors” said Rpdriguez, “To be part of a growing organization in the greater Muskegon area is a blessing. When my father passed away we had very little, so we had to work hard. We had to rise and grind. And for this, I knew the Muskegon Risers was the perfect fit. I am happy for this opportunity and can’t wait for the start of the season.

Originally from Chicago, IL, Jubenal spent the majority of his youth playing soccer in Muskegon. Jubenal is a graduate of Muskegon high school where he earned 3 team MVPs, All-District, and All-Conference honors. More recently, Jubenal was recognized as Holland Soccer League’s (MI) Top Scorer in the 2011 and 2012 seasons.

We are very enthusiastic about Jubenal joining the squad – there are 5 more signings to announce following last week’s tryouts!
