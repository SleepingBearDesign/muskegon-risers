We are excited to announce Job Potter has signed with Muskegon Risers SC.

Job is a West Michigan native from the town of Sparta. Growing up, he played premier soccer with the Soccer Club of Rockford and was a 4-year MVP with the homeschool Hudsonville Hornets, leading them to a National Championship. Job played college ball at Mt. Vernon University.

“Signing with the Risers is huge” Job said, “I feel excited and honored to be on this team and can’t wait to get started.”

Job is the seventh of ten players signed after tryouts last week. Stay tuned for the remaining three!
