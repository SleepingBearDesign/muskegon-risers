Damian Goncalves is the club’s 17th signing, which leaves 5 roster spots available ahead of the staff’s visit to South Africa in February.

Originally from Durban, South Africa, Goncalves has nearly 23-years of playing experience. Before playing at Davenport University, Goncalves competed in the youth ranks for Zulu Natal and Pinetown District of South Africa.

Goncalves is proud to be a member of the Risers family and believes “soccer is not just a game, it is a way of life.”
