Matt DeKryger is the final Riser we will announce today.

Originally from Fremont, MI, DeKryger attended Western Michigan Christian high school, graduating in 2011. During that time, DeKryger won a state championship with the Warriors. After high school, DeKryger became a student-athlete at Calvin College, winning 3 conference championships and making 2 NCAA tournament appearances. Calvin was a national finalist in 2011.

DeKryger stated:
>As a Muskegon-area native, not only am I excited to join the Muskegon Risers, but to also have a part in bringing higher-level soccer to the lakeshore. I look forward to using the Risers as a platform to help continue to grow soccer in and around Muskegon.

Its clear the coaching staff is targeting quality players and people in their talent search. DeKryger is the 4th of 10 players to sign after tryouts last week. More announcements to follow this weekend!
