Muskegon Risers SC extends a warm welcome to Ben Honeycutt.

Honeycutt, a native of Grandville, has played club ball for Georgetown Rangers, West Michigan Edge, Fire Juniors, and Fort Wayne Fever. He had an excellent college career, playing for Calvin College where he captained the team his senior year.

“Be just and justify your actions, lead and never follow, love as you are loved, and humble yourself and pray” – words which Ben chose to share for his signing.

Stay tuned as we have one more Riser to announce from tryouts!
