Rounding out today’s announcements is Holland, MI native Diego Bobadilla.

Diego has playing experience with Crew Juniors, Cornerstone University, Alliance FC, Ole SC, and the Abk Futsal Academy. Diego’s development as a player and person will be highly valued by Muskegon Risers SC.

>I’m very excited to be a part of this new organization and I can’t wait to hit the field with all of these really talented players.

We have two more players to announce from last week’s tryouts in Muskegon!
