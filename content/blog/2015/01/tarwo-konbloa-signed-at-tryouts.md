Tarwo Konbloa is the second signing announced following tryouts last weekend. Tarwo wrote an excellent bio, which we have quoted below.

>I started playing football, what you know as soccer in the United States, at the age of five as a street soccer player in the Ivory Coast. At that time, I didn’t really understand the fundamentals of the game besides it being a fun game that everyone enjoys playing in the refugee camp. I came to the United States in 2004 and a year later, I learned the fundamentals of the game, including tactics and technique with and without the ball under Coach Hagene, who’s now my mentor and true family friend. From there, soccer has been keen in my life. I have won three state championships at East Kentwood, won a state cup with the Wolves, and am currently a senior at Hope College.

>Making the Muskegon Risers team will be a step forward to pursuing my childhood dream. I have always said to myself as a motivator that ‘If I quit, what will I do? If I succeed, where will I land? The question to ponder.’ This is a small window of opportunity that God has opened for me and as always, I will be looking forward to this challenge.
