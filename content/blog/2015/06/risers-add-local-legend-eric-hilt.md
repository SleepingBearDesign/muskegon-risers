After beginning the season with a winning record, your Muskegon Risers SC looked for different ways to continue improving each week. When it came to improving the team’s roster, the coaches looked to bring on talented players who have a history of success on and off the field. None could be truer, then when talking about Eric Hilt. Eric has achieved high levels of success on the field such as being named Male athlete of the year, All-Region and All-Tournament teams during his time at Muskegon Community College and second team All-State during his senior year at Reeths Puffer High School. Eric’s success does not end there; he was also named Academic All-Conference, Dean’s List and President’s List during his time at Muskegon Community College.

When asked about how Eric felt when signing with the Muskegon Risers, here is what the Muskegon born product had to say, “I never thought this opportunity would come about, but now that I have earned it, I am excited to play representing my hometown.”
