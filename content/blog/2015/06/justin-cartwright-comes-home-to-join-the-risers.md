Continuing on with the second signing from training Monday, the Muskegon Risers added even more talent to the roster with the addition of Justin Cartwright. After surveying the fields of Iowa, where Justin played his college ball at Wartburg University, the Risers’ coaching staff knew they needed to bring Justin in for a training session, where he eventually signed following the session. Justin has achieved high levels of success on the field, including All-District honors as well as helping Wartburg University reach the sweet sixteen of the NCAA tournament. Off the field, Justin takes just as much pride in his work. Justin was named to the dean’s list as well as a board of regents scholar, during his time at Wartburg. During his time in high school, Justin was also an Academic All-American swimmer.

When asked how he felt about signing with the Muskegon Risers SC, Justin had this to say, “I am excited to be coming back home and playing for the Risers. I cannot wait to get out on the field, start playing and represent the beautiful City of Muskegon.”
