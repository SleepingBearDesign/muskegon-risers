After a long two weeks away from the Muskegon Lakeshore, the Risers will look to continue their dominance at home against Brujos FC. The game is set to be played, in the friendly confines, of Reeths Puffer High School’s soccer field at 6pm tomorrow night. The team is coming off a long road trip last weekend, where they dropped a tight 2-0 decision against the Des Moines Menace. The loss ended the Risers’ three game winning streak, but the team has not lost focus on continuing to improve in the coming weeks.

Tomorrow’s match against Brujos, will be the start of a six game home stand for the Risers. Some players to look for in the match will be goalkeeper Reece Richardson, and forward Brogan Shrimpton. Reece is coming off a hot game, on the road, against a talented Des Moines squad. Although the Risers gave up two goals, Reece kept his team from falling even further behind, and gave them every opportunity to mount a comeback in the match. Up top, Brogan has provided the Risers with a consistent attack all season long. Last weekend saw Brogan’s goal streak come to an end, so the team will look for him to get back on the scoresheet tomorrow night.

For a reminder to the fans, it is important to remember the different Riser programs set in place throughout the summer. These programs include; Write to a Riser, Risers Read and 90 for 90. More information on these programs can be found on the Risers’ blog, which is connected to the team’s webpage.

Tickets can be purchased at the game, on the team’s website or at The Block ticket office, in downtown Muskegon. No matter where you get your ticket, the price of admission will always be $5. The Muskegon Risers SC would also like to thank the continued support West Michigan has provided.
