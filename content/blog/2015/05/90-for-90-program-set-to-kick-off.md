90-FOR-90 is a program The Muskegon Risers established to motivate our youth to get outside, be more active and possibly develop the next generation of Risers!

If a youth club soccer player can practice outside of their team’s practice for 90 minutes the week before a Risers’ home game, the player will be given free admission for that week’s game! Yes, I said FREE ADMISSION! With the help of a parent, the player must print off the 90-FOR-90 form, fill it out and bring it to the ticket booth in order to complete the process.

An example of the form can be found on the top of the page, and will consist of the following: student’s name, club’s name and parent/legal guardian’s initials.

The Muskegon Risers Soccer Club hope to use this program in motivating our youth to get outside and exercise more often. Through exercise, The Muskegon Risers Soccer Club believes they will build a more disciplined and motivated generation for years to come!
