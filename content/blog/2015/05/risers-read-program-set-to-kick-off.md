As a kid, did you ever want to be rewarded for the hard work you put into reading during those warm Summer months? Well now, there is that opportunity! With The Muskegon Risers Soccer Club’s new program called Risers Read, elementary students will be rewarded for their reading efforts this Summer!

If an elementary student can read for 90 minutes the week of a home game, for The Muskegon Risers Soccer Club, the student will be given free admission for that week’s game! Yes, I said FREE ADMISSION! With the help of a parent, the student must print off the Risers Read form, fill it out and bring it to the ticket booth in order to complete the process.

An example of the form can be found on the top of the page, and will consist of the following: student’s name, elementary school’s name and parent/legal guardian’s initials.

The Muskegon Risers Soccer Club hope to use this program in motivating our youth to grow as a reader. With a strong reading ability for our youth, the Risers believe we can build a more educated and inspired generation!
