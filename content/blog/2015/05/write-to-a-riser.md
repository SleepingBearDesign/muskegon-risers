The Muskegon Risers Soccer Club has focused on working towards changing the way fans view professional sports, by making the Risers a more community-driven franchise. Such is the problem with most professional teams today, clubs forget about creating the connection between the players and their young fans. Young fans, who are easily impressionable, and look-up to these athletes as their role models.

When the Muskegon Risers’ coaching staff began to evaluate talent, for their roster, the coaching staff began with searching for men with great character to serve as role models for the community. Men who not only the coaching staff would be proud to stand behind, but likewise for the community.

This past weekend marked the beginning of the program titled *Write to a Riser*. A program that allows those of all ages to write letters to their favorite Muskegon Riser players/coaches, and have the players/coahces return those letters over the course of the season. Write to a Riser is a program the team is excited to get started after the incredible amount of support they have received from the West Michigan Community during their past two home games. The Risers understand that without the community’s support, the games would not be as enjoyable for them.

As for details about the Write to a Riser program, the link to the form is attached at the top of this article. You may write your letter on there and fill-out the form accordingly. All letters can be delivered to the merchandise table during all Muskegon Risers home games, or emailed to [salim.al-shatel@muskegonrisers.com](mailto:salim.al-shatel@muskegonrisers.com). From there, the letters will be delivered to the players and they will respond by the next home game.

We hope with the *Write to a Riser* program, we can create friendships that last a lifetime.
