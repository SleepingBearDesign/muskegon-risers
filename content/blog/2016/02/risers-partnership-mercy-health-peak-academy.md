The Muskegon Risers have a clear vision for positive social and economic change in MKG through the game of soccer. This mission has attracted strong partnerships with immensely talented people and businesses across our community. Today, we are proud to announce an even stronger partnership with Mercy Health and PEAK Training Academy.

In 2016, Mercy Health will have an increased presence at Risers practices and games through their athletic training staff. Muskegon Risers athletes embody the values of this team in everything they do, and Mercy Health's increased commitment will help maximize our athletes' ability to affect positive change in MKG.

PEAK Training Academy has a diverse, skilled and certified staff with proven experience providing evidence-based, cutting-edge and comprehensive services for the high performing athlete. Every week during the season, PEAK Training Academy will collaborate with Muskegon Risers athletes and coaches to optimize the team's performance using PEAK's proprietary training methods.

The Muskegon Risers are excited to continue an upward trajectory as a program with the strong support of Mercy Health and PEAK Training Academy!
