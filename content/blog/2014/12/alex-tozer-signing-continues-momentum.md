Alex Tozer is out to make a name for himself in the US Soccer landscape.

The 23 year old from Milwaukee, WI was recently added to the US futsal national team talent pool and is excited to develop with the Risers in 2015, “I’m looking forward to becoming part of Risers SC this coming season” said Tozer, “I’m thrilled to join a club that shares the same vision and values for the game as I do. Coming from Milwaukee, youth soccer development is a lifestyle to me and is very important, I’m glad I am able to continue this with my transition to Muskegon.”

Tozer is currently playing for the Milwaukee Wave as a defender this winter, and Risers Head Coach David Wood believes Tozer will make an impact at a variety of positions in Muskegon, “I am very happy that Alex has decided to join the Risers in 2015.  Alex is definitely going to make a big impact on and off the field.” Wood continued, “He is a very gifted player and can play in numerous positions. He is definitely going to be an important player for us this year.”

Tozer will wear #14 and becomes the 6th player signed by Muskegon Risers SC, continuing the club’s momentum ahead of 2015.
