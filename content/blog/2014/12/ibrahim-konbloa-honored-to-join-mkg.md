Following a very competitive trial period in Muskegon on December 26 and 27, the Risers coaching staff has selected ten athletes to add to the 2015 roster.

Konbloa is our first announcement. A graduate of East Kentwood high school, Ibrahim won three state championships and also played academy soccer for CSA Wolves.

Wolves expanded Ibrahim’s game tremendously, as he was given opportunities to compete against US National, Mexican National, and Brazilian National Teams. Ibrahim has also competed overseas in the Viareggio Cup in Italy, playing against clubs like PSV of Holland.

“Signing a new contract with Muskegon Risers SC is an honor” said Ibrahim, “I expect it to expand my soccer career and am looking forward to a great season.”

Stay tuned as we announce more signings from December!
