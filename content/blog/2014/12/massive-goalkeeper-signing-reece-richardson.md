Reece Richardson, who stands 6’7″ in beach sand, will have massive presence at GK. His experience will be just as big, leading Forest City London to a championship in 2012 and earning several defensive honors throughout his collegiate career at Indiana Tech University.

“It is fantastic to have Reece signing with us” said Risers Head Coach, David Wood, “He is very experienced which is going to be invaluable for the team”

Risers Goalkeeper Coach, Joe Brefczynski, shares Wood’s sentiments, “Reece provides us with experience and leadership in goal that only comes from playing at a very high level. He knows how to perform under pressure and win. We couldn’t ask for a better addition to our team.”

Richardson is originally from Halifax, England and now lives and works along the Muskegon lakeshore. His connection to the area makes him a perfect fit for the team’s mission in the community as well.

For Richardson, “Its such a great opportunity play the sport I love, while representing a club that has great ambitions, not only as a club but for the community of Muskegon.”

7 of the 22 roster positions have now been filled by the Risers coaching staff. To recap each signing, please visit [muskegonrisers.com/blog](http://muskegonrisers.com/blog).
