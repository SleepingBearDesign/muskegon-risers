We all hoped this was coming, and now its official. Hennessy’s Irish Pub & Restaurant in Downtown Muskegon has agreed to host all US National Soccer Team watch parties through 2015. In doing so, Hennessy’s also becomes the first local restaurant to sponsor the Risers during our inaugural season.

This partnership comes after an exciting summer of US Soccer during the World Cup, and with so many national games to come, Hennessy’s is excited to have everyone back.

A huge amount of credit goes to the Risers supporter group founder, Dylan Darga. In early May, it was Dylan who helped the organization secure an initial watch party after meeting with Hennessy’s owner, Mr. Mike Hennessy. “Anywhere you sit is a great spot to enjoy food and beverages. Its local, right in Downtown Muskegon which is what we wanted” Darga said, “Hennessy’s is an amazing venue for people to come together to enjoy the game of soccer and, more importantly, enjoy the Downtown Muskegon experience.”

In case you missed it, here’s the scene from summer 2014.

We’ll keep everyone posted regarding future watch parties and, of course, the 2015 Riser game schedule!
