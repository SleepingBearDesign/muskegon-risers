In June of 2011, Tom Gores was interviewed by Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press regarding his recent purchase of the Detroit Pistons NBA franchise. Toward the middle of his Q&A, Gores quipped, “I always want to create value; I never want to buy value.” In other words, Gores believes in building versus buying. He was probably the kind of kid who made his Halloween costumes from scratch, and the type of guy who gets a kick out of restoring vintage cars. Pure speculation, of course.

So what does Tom Gores have to do with the Muskegon Risers? His creative philosophy is directly applicable to our current field search. We’ve had conversations with Mona Shores, Reeths-Puffer, and Muskegon about the possibility of renting their high school fields, but none seem to be a perfect fit at the moment. Beyond growing the game of soccer, the purpose of the Risers is to help revitalize Muskegon in part by creating an authentic experience. With this vision, our focus shifted to the downtown waterfront.

After meeting with the Muskegon Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Muskegon Now, and the Community Foundation of Muskegon in June, we were referred to a piece of property currently owned by Mart Dock at the end of 3rd Street, just southwest of the Shoreline Inn, and directly overlooking Muskegon Lake. Yes, the site presents an ideal opportunity to create value.
 

In late July, we connected with the President of Mart Dock, Max McKee, about the possibility of utilizing the property for a trial period. After speaking with nearby business leaders, including Shoreline Inn’s Jon Rooks, Mr. McKee has given us the green light to utilize the space for a minimum of 3 years, so long as the Risers generate the necessary funds to install a temporary facility. Like anything else in business, its always wise to test an idea first and this 3-year minimum allows all parties involved to do just that.

“The Risers bring a unique and creative perspective to Muskegon” said Mr. McKee, “If the Riser group is able to pull the necessary partners together, we are onboard with this inclusive community vision that goes beyond just a soccer field.”

There is still much to be done before we can call the 3rd Street lot home through 2017. It is now on the Risers to pool investors and close this deal. Nonetheless, we have a premier opportunity to help continue creating value in Downtown Muskegon – Tom Gores would be proud.
