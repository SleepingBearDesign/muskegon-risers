Jai Maw is the second player in as many weeks to sign with Muskegon Risers Soccer Club ahead of the 2015 season.

Jai is excited to be playing with a new team and being one of the founding players working in an enthusiastic community where soccer will continue to grow.

Head Coach, David Wood, is very pleased with signing Maw, “I am thrilled that Jai has decided to join the Risers. He is an exceptional player on and off the field.” Wood continued, “He is a dynamic player and very versatile. I know he is very excited about joining the Risers and getting going. We are still in our early stages of recruiting, but to have already signed the caliber of player as both Jai and Jamar is fantastic.”

Jai played four years of collegiate soccer for NAIA institution Davenport University, where he was successful in helping his program win the WHAC regular season and tournament on two separate occasions. Jai enjoyed a successful first year with Davenport being named to the honorable-mention conference team while experiencing his stand out season in his senior year recording 11 goals and 10 assists, culminating in a 1st team all-conference selection and a 2nd team all-region selection.

Jai, who is originally from England, excelled during three consecutive summers of semi-professional soccer playing with the St. Louis Lions, ending his career there by helping the team qualify as the final 16 teams in the country in 2014.

We look forward to what Jai will bring to Muskegon Risers SC as a player and person.
