Our coaching staff continues to build a professional product on the field, and the signing of Miguel Angeles is a direct result of that mission.

Miguel Angeles is a 6’1″, 185-pound product of Yavapai College, located in Prescott, AZ. His athleticism and versatility are characteristics which are highly valuable to the club.

“Miguel is a player which I have been speaking to for a while now. His attitude towards the game and willingness to learn are fantastic” said Risers Head Coach, David Wood, “He played at one of the top Junior Colleges in the country and we look forward to seeing him on the field”

In Yavapai’s 26 year history, the program has earned 7 National Championships while playing in 13 National Championship games. Clearly, Angeles understands the intangibles of a successful program, and the Risers look forward to his ability to help build a similar culture of success here in Muskegon.

According to Angeles, “I joined the Risers because when speaking with David I could tell his level of excitement about the club. I’m very excited to be part of a growing team, city, and organization.”

With this signing, Miguel Angeles becomes the third player to join Muskegon Risers Soccer Club ahead of our inaugural season beginning in May 2015. With Jai Maw signing earlier this month, our coaching staff is well on its way to building a professional product for the Muskegon lakeshore.
