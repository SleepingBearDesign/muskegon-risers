Assistant Coach Mike Lee is very enthusiastic about the latest signing for Risers SC – South African product, Alexi Munro.

Coach Lee, who is originally from South Africa, has been leveraging his connections back home and was able to sign Munro just before the holiday.

“We’re really excited that Alexi has joined us” said Lee, “He has incredible ability and brings a special dynamic which will be a huge asset to us.”

Munro was a standout player for semi-pro side, Rocket City United, and was voted MVP in his first year at the club. Munro, originally from Benoni, South Africa, has travelled all over the world to play soccer, including a trip to Scotland to represent South Africa in the Aberdeen Football Festival. Before playing for Rocket City United, Alexi played for FC LYN, which is part of a Norwegian premier league, as well as Kristiansund BK, which is also in Norway.

Head Coach David Wood is also thrilled with the signing, “Alexi is another fantastic signing for us. He has a proven track record of playing at the highest level and will bring a great deal of experience into the camp.”

With this signing, Alexi Munro joins Jai Maw and Miguel Angeles on the Risers 2015 roster.
