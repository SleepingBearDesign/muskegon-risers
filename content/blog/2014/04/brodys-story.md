*Passionate people and the execution of their ideas ultimately defines the success of any organization.*

It is this formula which pulses life through the inner-workings of companies, from social outreach programs to balancing the bottom line. When a group of people decides to introduce an idea to the world, its important for them to remember that chance favors the connected and the internet facilitates connectivity unlike any other medium in human history. From countrywide revolutions to YouTube sensations, people today have leveraged the online medium to create impact with brilliant variety. You have to wonder who creates in this medium, don’t you? Who is painting pictures of ideas in digital space that are then shared with the world? Formally, they are web developers. Informally, they’re geeks strung out on caffeine and speaking in code with a sort-of “I could totally crash your grid for three days” aura about them. When the Risers went about establishing an original online presence, we were not short of people, ideas, or purpose… we needed an artist who could paint our story in a way that authentically resonated with people from Whitehall to Grand Haven, and this is when Brody Berson came to play. This is Brody’s story.

Growing up in Muskegon, Brody values being part of “a close knit family of five, three boys who rough-housed throughout our entire childhood.” During his high school years, Brody was a varsity wrestler and cross-country runner, carrying the running passion with him through college, “I ran a half marathon last summer and was training for a full marathon this Memorial Day Weekend before I fractured my ankle a few weeks ago rock-climbing. I fell in love with rock-climbing at GVSU and that’s become my favorite thing to do in my off-time.”

At Grand Valley State University, Brody originally studied graphic design before switching his major to computer science. He credits a lot of his attention to detail, design, and awareness of the user experience to his time spent in graphic design. “I feel like web development is a creative medium where I can mix my two worlds of design and coding together to create something amazing and unique for individuals.” Brody actually just graduated last Saturday from GVSU with a degree in Computer Science and plans to join a small start-up in Chicago called RECSOLU where he will be an Application Support Specialist helping find bugs and presenting fixes to developers in their applications while freelancing websites on the side. Brody’s experiences before his first full-time gig at RECSOLU include interning at Delta Dental of MI and Red Frog Events out of Chicago. At Red Frog, Brody helped work on well-known websites like WarriorDash.com and GreatUrbanRace.com.

Probably the coolest element of Brody’s story is his passion for pushing the limits, “I like taking-on new and exciting challenges and always pushing the envelope in this ever-growing industry that changes on a daily basis. It’s fun to try and keep up with it and learn the latest and greatest.” This is a quality that clearly shows in the Risers site, as several elements were used for the first time from Brody’s ever-expanding knowledge base.

With this kind of talent just around the lake, we had to ask when he’ll be back. “I’ll always love where I came from here in Michigan. No matter where I go, the mitten will always be my home. From enjoying all the great craft beers, to the beaches, to hiking through our state parks and finding a nice hammock spot, Michigan is my home.” For now, Chicago presents a challenge worth accepting, as is the mentality of many recent college grads. With so much on the horizon, what’s next for Brody sounds a lot like freedom from arduous all-nighters, exams, and seemingly irrelevant college research papers on the behavior of primates. “This summer I look forward to starting my full-time job, going to Firefly Music Festival, living in Chicago, slacklining, hammocking, and meeting new friends and stuff. Haha I don’t really know where I’m going with this.” (Brody doesn’t get interviewed much… which will change). A lot of promise in this young man’s future, and he did admit “When I get older I see myself coming back here to Michigan.”

When asked if he would go to outer space if given the chance, Brody answered, “Hell yea, haha”… you’d be surprised how many people answer no to that question. Well done Brody, your hometown soccer team can’t thank you enough for the excellent work of art you created for us!
